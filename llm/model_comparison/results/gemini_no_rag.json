    "root_cause": "** \nFailure of the internal lubrication delivery system (specifically a detached or damaged oil bucket/scoop) or a sudden shift in axial thrust causing \"wiping\" of the bearing thrust face.\n\n**REASONING:**\n1.  **Rapid Temperature Gradient:** A rise of 30\u00b0C in only two hours is indicative of a \"thermal runaway\" condition. This suggests that the hydrodynamic oil film, which usually separates the shaft from the bearing liner, has been compromised, leading to metal-to-metal contact.\n2.  **Normal Oil Level vs. High Temp:** The fact that the oil level is normal rules out a catastrophic leak. However, a \"normal level\" does not mean the oil is reaching the load zone. In rotary kiln support rollers (which usually use oil scoops/buckets to lift oil to the top of the journal), a mechanical failure of a scoop would mean the bearing is \"starved\" despite the sump being full.\n3.  **Noise and Vibration:** These symptoms are classic indicators of mechanical interference. The noise likely stems from the \"scuffing\" or \"galling\" of the white metal (babbitt) or bronze bushing. The slight vibration increase suggests that the friction is causing a stick-slip effect or that the bearing surface has already begun to deform/smear (wiping).\n4.  **Axial Thrust Component:** Rotary kilns are designed to move axially. If the kiln shifted suddenly (due to changes in coating, temperature, or mechanical \"skew\" of other rollers), the thrust collar of the roller may be pressed too hard against the bearing face. If the lubrication film at that specific thrust interface fails, heat generates rapidly at that localized point and conducts through the entire housing.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 85% \n*(Note: A 100% diagnosis would require an oil analysis report and a visual inspection of the internal scoops and the thrust collar.)*\n\n**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:**\n1.  **Immediate Inspection (Internal):** Open the bearing housing inspection covers to check the condition of the oil scoops/buckets. Ensure they are securely fastened and effectively delivering oil to the top of the journal.\n2.  **Oil Quality Analysis:** Take a sample of the lubricant immediately. Check for the presence of \"white metal\" or bronze particles (indicating bearing wear) and check for \"darkening\" or burnt odor (indicating thermal oxidation).\n3.  **Check Kiln Axial Position:** Verify the kiln's position relative to the thrust rollers. If the kiln is \"heavy\" on the downhill side, it may be overloading the thrust face of this specific support roller. Adjusting the roller \"skew\" (bore-sighting) may be necessary to relieve pressure.\n4.  **Bearing Surface Restoration:** If the temperature reached 100\u00b0C, the babbitt (white metal) has likely undergone \"wiping.\" The bearing should be dismantled, and the high spots/scuff marks should be hand-scraped to restore the hydrodynamic oil grooves.\n5.  **Cooling System Verification:** If the bearing is water-cooled, check for scale buildup or airlocks in the cooling coils that might have reduced heat dissipation efficiency during a minor friction event.",
