The equipment reached 100\u00b0C, indicating a severe deviation from the \"normal working condition.\"\n4.  **Mechanical Correlation:** Document 5 explicitly links \"Noise of thrust roller bearing\" to \"Damaged bearing.\" While this is a support roller, the mechanical principles remain the same: noise and vibration in a bearing housing typically result from irregular surfaces on the rollers or races, which generates friction and leads to the rapid heat spikes observed.\n5.  **Alignment Factors:** Document 5 also suggests that \"incorrect skew of roller station\" creates excessive force. This excessive force can cause the bearing to fail prematurely, leading to the noise and vibration reported.\n\n**CONFIDENCE:** 85%\n*(High confidence in mechanical damage; the remaining 15% uncertainty accounts for potential external heat radiation from a kiln shell \"hot spot\" near the bearing, though that would not typically cause noise and vibration.)*\n\n**CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:**\n1.  **Immediate Internal Inspection:** Open the bearing housing (as per Document 1/2, \"lift off the upper housing member\") to inspect the rolling elements, cage, and races for signs of pitting, spalling, or discoloration from heat.\n2.  **Debris Analysis:** Check the existing grease/oil for metal particles or contaminants. If found, this confirms internal mechanical failure.\n3.  **Check Roller Alignment (Skew):** Verify the \"parallelism\" of the roller station relative to the kiln shell center line (Doc 4/5). If the roller is incorrectly skewed, it must be adjusted to reduce axial thrust.\n4.  **Bearing Replacement:** If physical damage (spalling/cracking) is detected, replace the bearing entirely as recommended in the troubleshooting table (Doc 5).\n5.  **Lubrication System Flush:** Before restarting with a new bearing, clean the grease pipes and housing thoroughly to ensure no residual metal shavings remain to contaminate the new lubricant (Doc 5: \"Clean grease pipe, repair lubricating unit\").\n6.  **Insulation Check:** Inspect the heat-insulating unit near the bearing (Doc 5) to ensure local kiln shell heat is not contributing to the bearing's thermal load.",
