          "answer": "** Based on the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Section 2, Page 56-38 and Table 8-2)**, this signal failure (plant-credible terminology for \"Unavailable\") was triggered by **thermal degradation of the sensor signal circuit** caused by excessive radiant heat. The manual explicitly states that the **\"highest temperature of the rolling bearing can not be above 80\u00b0C.\"** When the bearing temperature rose to 95\u00b0C and reached the 100\u00b0C alarm threshold, it indicates a failure of the **\"heat-insulating unit\"** (listed as a critical inspection point in the manual). \n\nAccording to Table 8-2 (Common Troubles), a \"Damaged heat-insulating unit\" leads to the **\"Radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat.\"** In an industrial control environment, this localized high-temperature radiation causes the temperature transmitter or its cabling to exceed its operating environment specifications, resulting in a **\"Signal Unhealthy\"** or **\"Comm Fail\"** status. The \"high demand\" referenced in the previous error corresponds to a **Network/Processor Overload** in the PLC/SCADA system, often caused by a \"data storm\" of rapid, out-of-range signal fluctuations (spurious interrupts) generated by the failing sensor before it went completely offline.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual\n\n**",

          "question": "** Why did the thermal degradation of the sensor signal circuit occur, and why was the \"heat-insulating unit\" in a condition that allowed the \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell\" to compromise the bearing seat and its instrumentation?",
          "answer": "** Based on the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Table 8-2 and Section 2, Page 56-38)**, the thermal degradation occurred because the physical barrier intended to shield the bearing assembly\u2014the **\"heat-insulating unit\"**\u2014was not \"complete and in good condition,\" leading to a localized environment that exceeded the 80\u00b0C limit for the rolling bearing and the operating range of the attached sensors. \n\nAccording to the **\"Common Troubles\" (Table 8-2)**, there are two primary reasons for this specific thermal state:\n1.  **Mechanical Trigger (Internal Heat):** The rapid 30\u00b0C temperature rise in only 2 hours suggests an **\"Incorrect skew of roller station,\"** which causes **\"excessive force on bearing.\"** This mechanical misalignment generates rapid frictional heat within the bearing itself.\n2.  **Protection Failure (External Heat):** The manual explicitly links \"Radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat\" to a **\"Damaged heat-insulating unit.\"** \n\nBased on inference, the failure of the heat-insulating unit likely resulted from a lack of adherence to the maintenance requirement on **Page 56-38**, which mandates operators to **\"Inspect whether or not... heat insulating unit is complete and in good condition.\"** If the insulation was missing, thinned, or physically displaced, it would allow the kiln shell\u2019s radiant heat to bake the bearing housing. This external heat, combined with the internal heat from the \"incorrect skew,\" created a compounded thermal load that caused the grease to lose \"cone penetration\" (as noted in Table 8-2 regarding noise and temperature) and triggered the \"Signal Unhealthy\" status through the thermal breakdown of the sensor's wiring or transmitter components.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual\n\n**",

          "question": "** Why was the heat-insulating unit allowed to become \"damaged\" or \"incomplete,\" and why was the \"incorrect skew\" of the roller station not identified and corrected before the 2-hour temperature spike?",
          "answer": "** Based on the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Page 56-38 and Table 8-2)**, these conditions persisted due to a failure in the preventative maintenance (PM) program to provide verifiable inspection criteria and the lack of a precision alignment protocol for the roller stations.\n\n1.  **Subjective Inspection Standards for Insulation:** While the manual mandates on **Page 56-38** to \"Inspect whether or not... heat insulating unit is complete and in good condition,\" the maintenance procedure likely relied on qualitative visual checks rather than quantitative measures (such as thermographic/infrared scanning). This allowed the \"Radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat\" (**Table 8-2**) to progressively degrade the grease's cone penetration and the sensor integrity without triggering a \"fail\" status during routine inspections.\n\n2.  **Lack of Precision Alignment Verification:** The **\"Incorrect skew\"** identified in **Table 8-2** as a cause for overheating indicates that the roller station center line was no longer \"parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell\" (**Page 56-38**). \n    *   **Based on inference**, the rapid temperature rise suggests that a mechanical shift occurred\u2014likely during a previous \"temporary stop\" or \"restart\" (as discussed in **Section 8.2.4 of the Traveling Grate Manual**)\u2014and the subsequent \"adjustment of the roller station,\" which the manual warns \"shall be avoided as far as possible,\" was either performed without precision measurement or the \"push force\" was not verified to be \"uniform\" and \"upward\" after the kiln reached operating temperature.\n\n3.  **Ineffective Lubrication Frequency:** The manual specifies that \"grease inside the bearing seat shall be cleaned and replaced once a half year\" (**Page 56-38**). However, the \"Overheat\" caused by the skew and radiation likely accelerated the \"deterioration of grease\" (**Table 8-2**) faster than the standard 6-month interval could accommodate. The system failed because it did not trigger a \"shorten intervals of grease supply\" or \"makeup grease\" action despite the changing thermal conditions.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual, Traveling Grate_Hongda_OEM Manual\n\n**",

This overcurrent was caused by an excessive aerodynamic load on the fan, evidenced by the inlet damper being 75% open and the system draft pressure being higher than normal. \n\nAccording to the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual (Section 3.8)**, the fan is classified as a \"Group 1\" large machine (rated power >300 kW). Since the observed symptoms indicate that vibration levels remained within normal limits (below the 5.62 mm/s alarm threshold for rigidly mounted machines or 8.87 mm/s for flexibly mounted machines), mechanical causes such as bearing seizure or rotor imbalance are effectively ruled out. \n\nThe high draft pressure and overcurrent suggest that the fan was moving a higher mass flow of gas than the motor could support at a 75% damper opening. This is likely due to either a drop in flue gas temperature (increasing gas density and motor load) or an upstream breach/bypass opening. Specifically, the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual (Page 4, Item 9)** strictly prohibits opening ESP Hopper By-Pass chutes during operation; if such a bypass or a \"Hopper by-pass chute dummy flange\" (Item 8) were not air-tight, the fan would draw excess air, leading to the observed higher draft and motor overload.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:**\nID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual, ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual\n\n**",
