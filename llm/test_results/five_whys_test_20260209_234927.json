    "result": "tool_name='5_whys' success=True result={'why_steps': [{'step_number': 1, 'question': 'Why did this failure occur?', 'answer': 'The rotary kiln support roller bearing temperature exceeded its maximum allowable operating limit of 80\u00b0C (as specified in Document 4) and reached the 100\u00b0C alarm setpoint due to excessive frictional heat generation within the bearing housing. This rapid temperature rise, accompanied by unusual noise and increased vibration, indicates a mechanical distress state. According to the troubleshooting guide in Document 5, these specific symptoms (overheat, noise, and vibration) are typically caused by an incorrect skew of the roller station leading to excessive force on the bearing, or internal damage to the bearing itself. While the oil level appeared normal, Document 5 also suggests that \"impurities exist inside bearing seat\" or \"misusage and deterioration of grease\" can cause such overheating. The increase in vibration and noise specifically points toward \"Damaged bearing of thrust roller\" or \"Excessive axial/radial pushing force\" due to misadjustment (Document 5).', 'supporting_documents': ['Document 4', 'Document 5'], 'confidence': 0.9}, {'step_number': 2, 'question': 'Why did The rotary kiln support roller bearing temperature exceeded its maximum allowable operating limit of 80\u00b0C (as specified in Document 4) and reached the 100\u00b0C alarm setpoint due to excessive frictional heat generation within the bearing housing?', 'answer': 'The excessive frictional heat and mechanical distress were caused by a failure in the roller station\u2019s alignment stability and the breakdown of the lubrication delivery system. According to Document 5, \"Incorrect skew of roller station\" and \"misadjustment\" create \"excessive axial pushing force,\" which forces the bearing to operate under loads exceeding its design parameters, leading to rapid heat generation. Document 4 specifies that the center line of the roller station must be kept \"as parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell\" to minimize push force. Additionally, the rapid temperature rise (30\u00b0C in 2 hours) suggests a critical lack of fresh lubricant reaching the contact surfaces; Document 5 identifies \"grease pipe blocking\" or \"trouble on lubricating unit\" as primary causes that prevent grease from flowing to the \"lubricating point of bearing.\" This is further compounded if the \"half-year\" grease replacement and cleaning interval required by Document 4 was neglected, leading to \"deterioration of grease\" and \"impurities\" that increase internal friction rather than reducing it.', 'supporting_documents': ['Document 4', 'Document 5'], 'confidence': 0.9}, {'step_number': 3, 'question': 'Why did the excessive frictional heat and mechanical distress occur due to a failure in the roller station\u2019s alignment stability and the breakdown of the lubrication delivery system?', 'answer': 'The breakdown of these systems occurred because of a failure to maintain the mechanical integrity of the supporting components and a lapse in the specialized maintenance required for high-temperature operations. \\n\\nFirst, the alignment instability resulted from either a failure of the \"fastening part and anchor bolt of the supporting device\" (Document 4) to remain secure, or an improper manual adjustment that failed to keep the roller station \"parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell\" (Document 4). Document 5 confirms that \"misadjustment of roller station\" or an \"excessive tilt of roller station center line\" creates the excessive axial pushing force that drives temperatures up.\\n\\nSecond, the lubrication system failed to provide effective cooling and friction reduction due to two likely factors:\\n1. **Maintenance Interval Lapse:** The \"grease inside the bearing seat\" was likely not \"cleaned and replaced once a half year\" as strictly mandated by Document 4. This leads to the \"deterioration of grease\" and the accumulation of \"impurities exist inside bearing seat\" (Document 5), which causes pipe blockages.\\n2. **Thermal Protection Failure:** Document 5 highlights that a \"damaged heat-insulating unit\" allows the \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell\" to impact the bearing seat. This radiation reduces the \"cone penetration\" (viscosity/consistency) of the grease, causing it to become too thin to maintain a protective film or flow correctly to the \"lubricating point of bearing,\" eventually leading to the rapid 30\u00b0C temperature spike observed.', 'supporting_documents': ['Document 4', 'Document 5'], 'confidence': 0.9}, {'step_number': 4, 'question': '** Why did the breakdown of these systems occur because of a failure to maintain the mechanical integrity of the supporting components and a lapse in the specialized maintenance required for high-temperature operations?', 'answer': '** These failures occurred because the facility\u2019s maintenance management system failed to integrate and enforce the specific, time-based, and condition-based requirements mandated by the OEM for high-stress rotary kiln components. This systemic oversight manifested in three specific areas:\\n\\n1.  **Inadequate Preventative Maintenance (PM) Scheduling:** The \"half year\" requirement to clean and replace the grease inside the bearing seat (Document 4) was likely not captured in the master maintenance schedule. This omission directly allowed for the \"misusage and deterioration of grease\" and the accumulation of \"impurities\" (Document 5), which are cited as primary drivers of overheating.\\n2.  **Failure of Condition-Based Inspection Protocols:** While general inspections occurred, there was a failure to prioritize the \"heat-insulating unit\" during routine checks. Document 4 explicitly requires inspecting if the \"heat insulating unit is complete and in good condition.\" Because this was not effectively monitored, the \"damaged heat-insulating unit\" went unrepaired, allowing \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell\" (Document 5) to thin the grease\\'s \"cone penetration,\" rendering it unable to lubricate the bearing at the \"lubricating point\" (Document 5).\\n3.  **Lack of Standardized Adjustment and Fastening Procedures:** The alignment instability suggests that the site lacked a rigid protocol for securing the \"fastening part and anchor bolt of the supporting device\" (Document 4). Furthermore, Document 4 warns that adjustments should be \"avoided as far as possible,\" but if \"indeed necessary,\" they must maintain a \"parallel\" center line. The \"incorrect skew of roller station\" (Document 5) indicates that when adjustments were made, they were likely performed without the precision tools or specific torque standards required to prevent \"excessive force on bearing\" (Document 5).\\n\\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Document 4, Document 5\\n\\n**', 'supporting_documents': ['** Document 4', 'Document 5\\n\\n**CONFIDENCE:** 90%'], 'confidence': 0.7}, {'step_number': 5, 'question': '** Why did the facility\u2019s maintenance management system fail to integrate and enforce the specific, time-based, and condition-based requirements mandated by the OEM for high-stress rotary kiln components?', 'answer': '** The root cause is the **absence of a formalized Asset Care Strategy (ACS) and Technical Documentation Audit process** during the equipment\u2019s commissioning or the transition to the current Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).
