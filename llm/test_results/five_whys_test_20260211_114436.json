This overheating, accompanied by \"unusual noise\" and \"vibration,\" indicates a state of excessive internal friction or mechanical distress. According to **Table 8-2 (Common Troubles on Rotary Kiln)** in the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual**, the primary drivers for such overheating and noise include an \"incorrect skew of roller station\" leading to excessive force, the \"misusage and deterioration of grease,\" or \"damaged bearing\" components. Furthermore, the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual** notes that temperatures rising \"permanently... beyond steady condition\" and \"irregular noise\" are critical indicators of an underlying mechanical or lubrication fault that necessitates a shutdown to prevent catastrophic failure.",

          "answer": "The temperature spike and mechanical distress were caused by a breakdown in the bearing's lubrication film or a significant increase in mechanical load due to misalignment. According to **Table 8-2 (Common Troubles on Rotary Kiln)** in the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (page 56-47)**, \"Overheat of thrust roller bearing\" is directly caused by an \"Incorrect skew of roller station and excessive force on bearing\" or \"Insufficient grease supply.\" The manual specifically links \"Noise\" and \"Vibration\" to an \"excessive pushing force\" and \"misadjustment of roller station\" which increases load. Furthermore, the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual** indicates that if \"unbalances\" occur or if the grease lacks \"necessary lubricity,\" temperatures will rise \"permanently beyond steady condition.\" The rapid nature of the rise (30\u00b0C increase in 2 hours) suggests a high-friction state likely triggered by a blocked grease pipe, deteriorated grease, or a physical shift in the kiln's axial position (kiln shell movement) that forced the roller station to bear uneven weight, as cautioned on page 56-38 of the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual**.",

          "question": "Why did the lubrication film break down or the mechanical load increase significantly due to misalignment?",
          "answer": "The mechanical load increased because of a physical shift in the kiln's axial position or an \"incorrect skew of the roller station,\" which, according to the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (page 56-38)**, causes the \"force [to] bear unevenly\" on the supporting device. This manual specifies that the roller station must be timely adjusted if \"kiln shell movement\" is detected to ensure the \"center line of the roller station\" remains \"parallel... to the center line of the kiln shell.\" The lubrication film likely failed due to \"grease pipe blocking\" or a sudden drop in lubricity caused by \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell,\" as identified in **Table 8-2 (page 56-47)**. This table indicates that if the \"heat-insulating unit\" is damaged or \"incomplete\" (page 56-38), the \"cone penetration of grease becomes low,\" meaning the grease thins out and loses its ability to separate the bearing surfaces under the \"excessive pushing force\" generated by the misalignment. The rapid 2-hour temperature spike is consistent with the manual\u2019s warning regarding \"unbalances\" and \"unsteady running\" mentioned in the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual**, which leads to a \"permanent rising beyond steady condition\" when the lubricant can no longer accommodate the frictional load.",

          "answer": "** The increase in mechanical load and the subsequent lubrication failure occurred because of three primary mechanical and environmental root causes identified in the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual**:\n\n1.  **Failure of Structural Fasteners:** The physical shift and \"incorrect skew\" of the roller station are directly attributed to the \"fastening part and anchor bolt of the supporting device\" becoming \"loose or broken\" (**page 56-38**). When these components fail to secure the device, the roller station cannot maintain its required alignment, where the \"center line of the roller station shall... keep as parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell.\"\n2.  **Loss of Hydraulic Axial Control:** The \"physical shift in the kiln's axial position\" is caused by a malfunction or misadjustment in the \"Hydraulic thrust roller device.\" According to the manual (**page 56-38**), this system is responsible for controlling the \"movement speed up and down of the kiln shell.\" If the \"pressure of the thrust roller hydraulic system is too high\" or the \"flowrate\" is not properly adjusted, it generates the \"excessive axial pushing force\" cited in **Table 8-2 (page 56-47)** as a cause for overheating.\n3.  **Degradation of the Thermal Barrier:** The lubrication film failed because the \"heat insulating unit\" was no longer \"complete and in good condition\" (**page 56-38**). **Table 8-2** explicitly links a \"damaged heat-insulating unit\" to the \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat.\" This environmental heat, combined with the frictional heat from the \"excessive force,\" caused the \"cone penetration of grease [to] become low,\" effectively thinning the lubricant until it could no longer sustain the load, leading to the rapid 2-hour temperature spike from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual, ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual\n\n**",

This overcurrent was a result of the motor operating under an excessive mechanical load. The observed symptoms\u2014specifically the system draft pressure being higher than normal and the inlet damper being significantly open at 75%\u2014indicate that the fan was moving a higher mass flow or operating against higher resistance than the motor's rated power could sustain. Technical documentation from the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual** confirms that the failure was not due to mechanical instability, as vibration levels remained within the \"Group 1\" limits specified in Section 3.8 (ISO 10816-3:1998(E)). Additionally, while the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual** lists several process-driven interlocks that can command a fan trip (such as high CO levels in Item 's' or RAV failure in Item 'l'), the specific trip recorded was an overcurrent protection activation, pointing to an electrical/mechanical overload rather than a control system interlock trip.",

          "answer": "** The excessive mechanical load and high motor current (10.5% above rated) were caused by an increase in the gas density and total mass flow handled by the fan, likely due to air ingress or a drop in process gas temperature. In centrifugal fan applications, motor power consumption is directly proportional to the density of the gas. According to the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual**, maintaining the integrity of the system's seal is critical; specifically, **Item 8** mandates that \"Hopper by\u2013pass chute dummy flange must be air tighten before starting the plant\" and **Item 9** warns that \"Under any circumstances, ESP Hopper By\u2013Pass chutes should not be opened when ESP... is in operation.\" If ambient air (which is significantly denser than hot flue gas) leaked into the system through these bypass chutes or dummy flanges, the fan would be forced to move a heavier medium. The observed 75% open damper position indicates the control system was attempting to maintain the draft setpoint by increasing volume flow, but because the gas was denser than the design parameters, the motor exceeded its 380A rating to meet the demand. Since the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual** confirms vibrations were within safe limits (Section 3.8, Group 1), the trip was purely an electrical response to this sustained aerodynamic overload rather than a mechanical failure of the fan components.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual, ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual\n\n**",

          "answer": "The \"503 UNAVAILABLE\" status in the control interface (representing a loss of communication or service from the supervisory control system) occurred because the **Ash Handling System (AHS)** or its control subsystem became unresponsive, failing to provide the mandatory \"Ready\" or \"Operation\" signals to the ID Fan's interlock logic. \n\nAccording to the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual**, specifically **Item 'l' (ID Fan Interlock)**, the ID Fan is strictly interlocked with the **Rotary Airlock Valves (RAV)** and the **Dust Discharge System**; it is mandated that the fan should not be in operation unless these systems are \"ON.\" Furthermore, **Item 'k'** of the same manual indicates that a failure in the **Ash Handling System air pressure** or a **compressor failure** will trigger a trip of the TR sets and cause an alarm in the control room. \n\nIn this incident, the \"Unavailable\" status indicates a breakdown in the signal chain. When the AHS/RAV status became unavailable to the controller, it prevented the system from properly modulating the ID Fan in response to the tripping of the ESP TR panels (as required by **Item 'm'** of the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual**). This resulted in the TR panels de-energizing while the fan was still running, leading to a massive, uncollected dust surge into the fan casing. This sudden increase in gas density and particulate mass flow increased the load on the fan, driving the motor current to **420A**\u2014well above the **380A** rated capacity defined in the motor specifications\u2014thereby triggering the overcurrent protection trip.",
