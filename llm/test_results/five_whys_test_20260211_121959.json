          "answer": "The rotary kiln support roller bearing temperature increased to 100\u00b0C, triggering an emergency shutdown, because the bearing entered an overheat condition that exceeded the OEM-specified maximum operating limit of 80\u00b0C (**Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual, Page 56-38**). The observed symptoms of \"unusual noise\" and \"slight vibration\" indicate that this temperature rise was driven by abnormal internal friction or mechanical stress. According to the troubleshooting guide in **Table 8-2 (Common Troubles on Rotary Kiln, Page 56-47)**, the most likely causes for simultaneous overheating and noise in these bearings are an \"Incorrect skew of roller station and excessive force on bearing,\" \"Misusage and deterioration of grease,\" or a \"Damaged bearing.\" While the lubrication oil level appeared normal, the manual notes that \"impurities exist inside bearing seat\" or \"grease pipe blocking\" can cause localized overheating despite a visible oil level.",

          "answer": "** Based on the symptoms of \"unusual noise\" and \"slight vibration\" combined with the rapid temperature rise, the overheat condition was likely caused by an **incorrect skew of the roller station**, which generated **excessive axial pushing force** on the bearing. According to the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Table 8-2, Page 56-47)**, \"Incorrect skew of roller station and excessive force on bearing\" is a primary cause for both overheating and vibration. The manual emphasizes that the \"center line of the roller station shall... keep as parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell\" (**Page 56-38**); a deviation from this parallelism increases mechanical friction and heat. Additionally, while the oil level appeared sufficient, the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Table 8-2)** notes that a \"Pipe of grease inside bearing is blocked\" or \"impurities exist inside bearing seat\" can prevent grease from flowing to the specific \"lubricating point of bearing,\" leading to localized thermal runaway despite a normal overall lubricant reservoir level.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** \n- Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Page 56-38, 56-47)\n- Table 8-2: Common Troubles on Rotary Kiln, causes and Troubleshooting\n\n**",

          "answer": "** In a plant environment, an \"Unavailable\" or \"503\" error code corresponds to a **Signal Unhealthy**, **Comm Fail**, or **Bad Quality** status on the Distributed Control System (DCS). This signal failure occurred because the physical temperature of the support roller bearing rose rapidly to 95\u00b0C (and eventually the 100\u00b0C alarm limit), which likely caused thermal damage or an open-circuit condition in the PT100/thermocouple sensor or its local junction box.\n\nBased on the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Table 8-2, page 56-47)**, the underlying physical cause for this \"Overheat of roller station bearing\" is an **\"Incorrect skew of roller station and excessive force on bearing.\"** The manual explicitly states that the \"center line of the roller station shall... keep as parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell\" (Page 56-38). When this parallelism is lost (incorrect skew), it creates excessive axial thrust and friction. This mechanical stress produces the rapid heat rise (65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C over 2 hours) that ultimately exceeded the environmental rating of the instrumentation, leading to the signal loss. Additionally, the **Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Table 8-1)** notes that \"Radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat\" can further exacerbate the thermal stress on both the lubricant and the monitoring hardware.\n\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Rotary Kiln_Hongda_OEM Manual (Section 56-38, Table 8-2 \"Common Troubles on Rotary Kiln\"), ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual (Reference for lubrication-induced heating).\n\n**",

Based on the observed symptoms, this overload was caused by the fan handling a gas mass flow rate or gas density that exceeded the motor\u2019s design limits at the current 75% inlet damper position. The \"higher than normal\" system draft pressure indicates the fan was producing high suction/work, which correlates with the high amperage. Mechanical failure (such as bearing seizure or impeller imbalance) is unlikely as the primary cause because fan vibrations remained within normal limits according to the **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual (Section 3.8, Table 2)**, which defines \"Normal\" start-up/alarm limits for Group 1 machines. Furthermore, while the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual (Page 3 of 4, Items g, s, and t)** lists several process interlocks that can trip the ID Fan (such as high CO levels or high hopper temperatures), the fact that the motor current was observed rising to 420A specifically indicates an electrical overload trip rather than a logic-driven interlock trip.",

          "answer": "The motor current exceeded its rated capacity because of a sudden increase in the gas density and total mass flow rate being handled by the fan. Based on inference from the \"higher than normal\" system draft and the \"normal\" vibration readings (which rule out mechanical binding), the fan was likely subject to significant ambient air ingress upstream. According to the **ESP_Thermax_OEM Manual (Page 4 of 4, Items 8 and 9)**, the air-tightness of \"Hopper by-pass chute dummy flanges\" is a mandatory requirement, and opening these chutes during operation is strictly prohibited. If a seal failed or a bypass flange became loose, the fan would pull in cold ambient air. Because motor power consumption is directly proportional to gas density, the introduction of cold air (which is much denser than process flue gas) significantly increases the brake horsepower required. At a 75% inlet damper position, the fan had insufficient head-room to accommodate this density spike, causing the motor to draw 420A to maintain the required torque.",

Furthermore, **Item 9** explicitly prohibits the opening of these chutes while downstream equipment (the ID Fan) is in operation. A failure in the gasket integrity or the loosening of the fastening bolts on these flanges\u2014possibly due to thermal cycling or improper torqueing during the last maintenance shutdown\u2014would allow the ID fan\u2019s suction to pull in high volumes of cold ambient air. Because cold air is significantly denser than the hot process flue gas, the mass flow rate increased beyond the motor's designed torque-to-current ratio at the 75% damper position. The fact that vibration remained normal (per **ID&HR Fan_TLT_OEM Manual, Section 3.8**) confirms the load was aerodynamic/fluid-driven rather than a result of mechanical contact or bearing failure.",
