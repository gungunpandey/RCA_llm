    "scenario": "Rotary Kiln Bearing Overheating",
    "result": "tool_name='5_whys' success=True result={'why_steps': [{'step_number': 1, 'question': 'Why did this failure occur?', 'answer': 'The rotary kiln support roller bearing experienced an abnormal temperature rise (reaching 100\u00b0C) and generated unusual noise and vibration because the bearing was subjected to excessive friction and mechanical stress. According to Document 4, the maximum allowable temperature for these rolling bearings is 80\u00b0C; the observed 95\u00b0C-100\u00b0C indicates a significant deviation from normal operating parameters. The symptoms of \"unusual noise\" and \"vibration\" align with the troubleshooting guide in Document 5, which attributes such overheating and noise to an \"incorrect skew of the roller station,\" leading to \"excessive force on the bearing.\" While the oil level appeared normal, the internal friction could also be aggravated by \"deterioration of grease\" or \"impurities exist inside the bearing seat,\" which prevents effective lubrication despite the presence of the lubricant.', 'supporting_documents': ['Document 4', 'Document 5'], 'confidence': 0.9}, {'step_number': 2, 'question': '** Why did the rotary kiln support roller bearing experience an abnormal temperature rise (reaching 100\u00b0C) and generate unusual noise and vibration because the bearing was subjected to excessive friction and mechanical stress?', 'answer': '** The excessive friction and mechanical stress occurred because the roller station\u2019s alignment deviated from its required parallel orientation to the kiln shell and the lubricant\u2019s efficacy was compromised by environmental heat or maintenance lapses. Specifically:\\n\\n1.  **Mechanical Misalignment and Axial Force:** According to **Document 4**, the \"center line of the roller station\" must be kept \"as parallel as possible to the center line of the kiln shell.\" When this alignment is lost\u2014referred to as \"incorrect skew\" or \"misadjustment\" in **Document 5**\u2014it generates an \"excessive axial pushing force\" and \"excessive radial pressure.\" This mechanical overload forces the bearing to operate beyond its design parameters, causing the rapid temperature spike and the \"unsteady running\" or vibration noted in **Document 1**.\\n2.  **Lubricant Degradation and Contamination:** **Document 5** identifies \"misusage and deterioration of grease\" and \"impurities inside the bearing seat\" as primary causes for overheating. This is often triggered by a \"damaged heat-insulating unit,\" which allows \"radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell\" to reach the bearing seat, lowering the \"cone penetration\" of the grease. \\n3.  **Maintenance Interval Compliance:** **Document 4** explicitly mandates that grease inside the bearing seat must be \"cleaned and replaced once a half year.\" If this interval is not strictly followed, or if \"grease pipe blocking\" occurs (**Document 5**), the bearing lacks the necessary lubricity to counteract the heat generated by the kiln\u2019s rotation, leading to the observed temperature rise from 65\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C.\\n\\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Document 1, Document 4, Document 5\\n\\n**', 'supporting_documents': ['** Document 1', 'Document 4', 'Document 5\\n\\n**CONFIDENCE:** 95%'], 'confidence': 0.7}, {'step_number': 3, 'question': 'Why did the excessive friction and mechanical stress occur because the roller station\u2019s alignment deviated from its required parallel orientation to the kiln shell and the lubricant\u2019s efficacy was compromised by environmental heat or maintenance lapses?', 'answer': 'The deviation in mechanical alignment and the degradation of lubricant efficacy occurred because the preventative inspection protocols for hardware integrity and the specialized cleaning procedures for the lubrication system were not effectively maintained. Specifically:\\n\\n1.  **Failure of Fastening and Anchoring Components:** According to **Document 4**, the stability of the roller station depends on whether \"each fastening part and anchor bolt of the supporting device are loose or broken.\" If these components are not securely maintained, the roller station can shift, causing the \"center line\" to lose its parallelism with the kiln shell. This shift leads to the \"incorrect skew\" and \"excessive axial pushing force\" identified in **Document 5** as a primary driver of mechanical stress.\\n2.  **Failure of Thermal Protection (Heat Insulation):** The lubricant\u2019s inability to withstand environmental heat is directly linked to a failure in the kiln\u2019s thermal shielding. **Document 5** identifies \"Radiation of local high temperature of kiln shell onto bearing seat\" as a cause for grease losing its \"cone penetration.\" This occurs specifically when the \"heat-insulating unit\" is \"damaged\" or not \"complete and in good condition\" as mandated by the inspection requirements in **Document 4**.\\n3.  **Accumulation of Contaminants and Blockages:** The compromise in lubricant efficacy was exacerbated by a failure to perform deep-cleaning during maintenance. **Document 5** cites \"impurities exist inside bearing seat\" and \"grease pipe blocking\" as reasons for overheating. While **Document 4** requires grease replacement every half year, **Document 1** and **Document 2** emphasize a rigorous \"LUBRICANT CHANGE\" process: the upper housing must be lifted, spent grease removed with a \"wooden spatula,\" and the bearing cleaned with \"machine oil.\" If these specific cleaning steps are bypassed, fresh grease becomes contaminated by \"spent grease\" and impurities, leading to the \"insufficient lubricity\" and \"un-allowed\" heating observed.', 'supporting_documents': ['Document 1', 'Document 2', 'Document 4', 'Document 5'], 'confidence': 0.9}, {'step_number': 4, 'question': '** Why did the deviation in mechanical alignment and the degradation of lubricant efficacy occur because the preventative inspection protocols for hardware integrity and the specialized cleaning procedures for the lubrication system were not effectively maintained?', 'answer': '** The failure to effectively maintain these protocols and procedures occurred because the facility\u2019s maintenance management system failed to synchronize the high-frequency operational monitoring with the specialized, condition-based requirements and rigorous cleaning standards defined across the OEM technical manuals. Specifically:\\n\\n1.  **Inadequate Translation of OEM Intervals into Site SOPs:** While **Document 4** mandates that grease be \"cleaned and replaced once a half year,\" it also explicitly requires that maintenance \"shorten intervals of grease supply\" or perform a \"necessary adjustment\" if conditions are not normal (**Document 4, 5**). The maintenance program likely relied on a fixed 6-month schedule, failing to trigger the \"timely\" replacements required when the system experienced the \"Radiation of local high temperature\" or \"impurities\" mentioned in **Document 5**.\\n2.  **Failure to Integrate \"Deep-Cleaning\" Specifications:** The specialized cleaning procedure\u2014which requires lifting the upper housing, using a \"wooden spatula\" to remove spent grease, and flushing with \"machine oil\" (**Document 1, 2**)\u2014is a complex intervention compared to standard lubrication. These specific steps were likely omitted from routine work orders, leading to \"grease pipe blocking\" and the accumulation of \"spent grease\" which **Document 1** warns causes \"heating to an un-allowed extent.\"\\n3.  **Lack of Specialized Hardware Inspection Frequency:** While **Document 3** establishes an \"every hour\" frequency for observing temperature and noise, the critical structural inspections\u2014specifically for \"loose or broken\" anchor bolts and the integrity of the \"heat insulating unit\" (**Document 4**)\u2014lack a defined high-frequency schedule in the manuals. Without a localized SOP to bridge this gap, the \"damaged heat-insulating unit\" and \"incorrect skew\" (**Document 5**) remained undetected until the bearing temperature exceeded the 95\u00b0C threshold.\\n4.  **Misinterpretation of Temperature Trends:** **Document 1 and 2** state that when temperature is \"permanently rising beyond steady condition,\" the operator must \"shutdown and eliminate the cause.\" The system allowed the temperature to climb from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C over two hours before shutdown, suggesting that the \"every hour\" inspection mandated in **Document 3** failed to trigger an immediate corrective \"elimination of the cause\" at the first sign of a non-steady rise.\\n\\n**SUPPORTING_DOCUMENTS:** Document 1, Document 2, Document 3, Document 4, Document 5\\n\\n**', 'supporting_documents': ['** Document 1', 'Document 2', 'Document 3', 'Document 4', 'Document 5\\n\\n**CONFIDENCE:** 92%'], 'confidence': 0.7}, {'step_number': 5, 'question': '** Why did the facility\u2019s maintenance management system fail to synchronize the high-frequency operational monitoring with the specialized, condition-based requirements and rigorous cleaning standards defined across the OEM technical manuals?', 'answer': '**\\nThe **ROOT CAUSE** is the absence of a centralized Technical Governance and Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) framework capable of reconciling disparate, multi-vendor OEM requirements into a single, unified Asset Management Plan. This systemic failure resulted in three critical organizational gaps:\\n\\n1.  **Technical Specification Siloing:** The maintenance system treated the specialized instructions from different OEMs (TLT for fans/bearings and Hongda for the kiln/grate) as isolated documents rather than an integrated system. Consequently, the specific \"Deep-Cleaning\" methodology (using a \"wooden spatula\" and \"machine oil\" flush per **Document 1 & 2**) was categorized as a secondary vendor recommendation rather than a primary maintenance requirement, leading to its omission from the computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) work orders.\\n2.  **Unresolved Parameter Conflicts:** The facility lacked a technical authority to resolve conflicting operational limits across manuals. While **Document 3** specifies a 65\u00b0C limit for driving units and **Document 4** sets an 80\u00b0C limit for roller station bearings, the facility set its alarm at 100\u00b0C.
